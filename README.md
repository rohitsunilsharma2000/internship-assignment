# 🧠 Advanced-Level Doctor Slot Management Use Cases

## 🔹 1. Create/Edit/Delete Slots
* Admin or Doctor can create available slots based on working hours.
* Support for single-day, recurring (daily/weekly), or date-range slots.
* Granular control over slot duration (e.g., 15/30/60 minutes).
* Option to block certain dates (e.g., holidays, conferences).
**Example**: Dr. Sen works Mon–Fri from 9 AM to 1 PM. Admin creates 30-minute slots from 9:00 to 12:30 daily.

## 🔹 2. Advanced Slot Customization
* Different time durations for different services (e.g., consultation = 15 min, surgery = 60 min).
* Color-coded slots for quick visualization (consultation, surgery, break).
* Add tags or notes for internal use (e.g., VIP patients, walk-in only).
**Example**: Consultation slots in green, Surgery slots in red, Break in gray; tagged as “VIP” or “Walk-in”.

## 🔹 3. Recurring Slot Templates
* Save reusable slot templates per week/day.
* Clone slots across multiple days or weeks.
* Create rotation schedules (e.g., alternate weekends off).
**Example**: Dr. Mehta’s Saturday schedule is saved as a template and reused every month.

## 🔹 4. Slot Availability Based on Doctor Type
* Part-time vs full-time doctors have different constraints.
* Locum doctors only available on ad-hoc basis.
* Multi-location support – doctor’s availability varies per clinic/branch.
**Example**: Dr. Das is available Mon-Tue at Clinic A and Wed-Fri at Clinic B.

## 🔹 5. Slot Conflict Management
* Prevent overlapping slots.
* Warn if the doctor is double-booked at multiple branches.
* Conflict detection with leaves, holidays, or ongoing surgeries.
**Example**: Dr. Roy is scheduled at two clinics on the same day – system alerts the conflict.

## 🔹 6. Bulk Slot Operations
* Bulk update (e.g., increase all consultation slots to 30 min).
* Bulk delete (e.g., doctor on leave for 1 week).
* Import slots from Excel/CSV or Google Calendar.
**Example**: All of Dr. Verma’s consultation slots increased from 15 to 30 min in one action.

## 🔹 7. Doctor Unavailability Management
* Mark unavailable dates or time ranges (vacation, surgery, emergencies).
* Temporary vs permanent unavailability.
* Auto-cancel affected appointments and notify patients.
**Example**: Dr. Ghosh on emergency leave – all appointments auto-cancelled, SMS sent to patients.

## 🔹 8. Slot Locking Mechanism
* Lock slots under booking (status = "PENDING") for a few minutes.
* Prevent race conditions with concurrency control (e.g., optimistic locking).
* Only allow one active booking per slot.
**Example**: Patient A starts booking; slot temporarily locked for 5 mins to complete checkout.

## 🔹 9. Smart Recommendations
* Auto-suggest available slots based on doctor's free time, patient preferences, or slot popularity.
* Highlight underutilized time blocks.
**Example**: Suggests 11:45 AM slot for Dr. Khan since earlier slots are filled and 12 PM is break time.

## 🔹 10. Walk-In & Emergency Slot Support
* Designate certain slots for walk-ins.
* Keep buffer slots for emergency cases.
* Walk-in queue management UI.
**Example**: 1 PM–1:30 PM left unbooked every day for emergency walk-ins.

## 🔹 11. Slot Analytics & Utilization Dashboard
* Visualize slot occupancy, cancellation rate, patient wait time.
* Heatmap of doctor’s peak vs idle hours.
* Suggestions to optimize slot distribution.
**Example**: Dashboard shows Dr. Sinha’s 10–11 AM slots are always idle — suggest reducing frequency.

## 🔹 12. Multi-Doctor Coordination
* Shared slots between junior/senior doctors.
* Delegate a slot to another doctor if unavailable.
* Handover mechanism with audit logs.
**Example**: Dr. Ali's slot reassigned to Dr. Kapoor due to an emergency; handover logged.

## 🔹 13. Patient Slot History
* View patient’s past booking pattern.
* Highlight frequent no-shows (may block slot booking for such users).
**Example**: Patient missed 3 out of last 5 appointments — warned before next booking.

## 🔹 14. Slot Booking Rules Engine
* Rule-based system to define:
  * Max appointments per day
  * Min gap between slots
  * Max advance booking days
  * Same-day booking cutoff time
**Example**: No more than 10 patients per day per doctor; 5-minute buffer between each slot.

## 🔹 15. Admin Alerts & Audit Logs
* Track who created, modified, or deleted a slot.
* Notify admin if any doctor cancels their entire day’s slots.
* Logs for slot overbooking attempts or suspicious activities.
**Example**: Admin alerted when Dr. Rao cancels all Monday appointments — reason recorded in log.

## 🔧 Tech Integration Suggestions

* **Backend**: Spring Boot + JPA (Slot Entity with SlotStatus ENUM)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (use timestamp ranges, conflict constraints)
* **Frontend**: React calendar with drag/drop support
* **Concurrency**: Redis-based locks or optimistic locking with version fields
