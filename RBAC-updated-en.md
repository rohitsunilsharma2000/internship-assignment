## üè• HMS Role-Based User Management & Module Access ‚Äî English Prompt

### üìå Step-by-Step Workflow:

1. ‚úÖ When a hospital purchases the HMS system, the first SUPER\_ADMIN registers themselves. A maximum of 2 SUPER\_ADMINs are allowed.
2. üîê The SUPER\_ADMIN logs in to the admin panel.
3. üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è The SUPER\_ADMIN can create the following user roles:

   * ADMIN
   * DOCTOR
   * NURSE
   * RECEPTIONIST
   * BILLING CLERK
   * PHARMACIST
4. üîê The ADMIN logs in to manage internal hospital operations.
5. üïê Either SUPER\_ADMIN or ADMIN sets up doctor availability and time slots.

### ‚úÖ Positive Case Scenarios (Allowed Role Creation)

| Logged-In Role         | Can Create Roles                                              | Reason                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| SUPER\_ADMIN           | ADMIN, DOCTOR, NURSE, RECEPTIONIST, BILLING CLERK, PHARMACIST | Has full authority and top-level administrative rights. |
| ADMIN                  | DOCTOR, NURSE, RECEPTIONIST, BILLING CLERK, PHARMACIST        | Manages hospital operations, not strategy.              |
| HR\_MANAGER (Optional) | NURSE, RECEPTIONIST, BILLING CLERK                            | HR-focused for staff hiring only.                       |
