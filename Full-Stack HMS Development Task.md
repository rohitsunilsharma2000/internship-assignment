## 📐 Architecture Guidelines

* Follow **SOLID** principles and layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
* Use design patterns like:

  * Strategy (role-based access)
  * Builder (prescription PDF generation)
  * Observer (Kafka event handling for notifications)
* Use DTOs, Validation, Exception Handling (`@ControllerAdvice`)
* Kafka should handle:

  * Prescription dispatch to Pharmacy

# Generate Prescription
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/prescriptions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## 🧪 UI Testing Steps

Follow the steps below to test the **React-based frontend** and verify end-to-end functionality across all modules.

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ OPD (Outpatient Department)**

#### 🔹 Patient Registration

* Go to `/opd/register`
* Fill in details: name, age, gender, contact, address, upload photo
* Submit → Check if a unique Patient ID is generated and displayed

#### 🔹 Doctor Appointment Booking

* Go to `/opd/appointment`
* Select patient, doctor, date, and available time slot
* Choose walk-in or online (if online, trigger payment screen)
* Confirm → View in “Upcoming Appointments”

#### 🔹 Doctor Consultation + Digital Prescription

* Login as doctor → Go to `/opd/consultation`
* Select today’s appointment
* Add symptoms, diagnosis, and prescribe medicines
* Save → Verify PDF prescription is auto-generated and downloadable

#### 🔹 OPD Visit History

* Go to `/opd/history/{patientId}`
* View all past visits, filters by date/doctor
* Select any visit → Check symptoms, diagnosis, prescription from previous consultation

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ IPD (Inpatient Department)**

#### 🔹 Admission Workflow

* Go to `/ipd/admit`
* Select patient → Assign ward, bed, doctor
* Add admission notes, attendant details
* Upload insurance if applicable → Submit → Ensure initial deposit flow is triggered

#### 🔹 Bed Allocation & Transfer

* Go to `/ipd/bed-dashboard`
* View current bed statuses (vacant/occupied/cleaning)
* Click on a patient → Reallocate to different ward/ICU
* Ensure old bed is marked for cleaning

#### 🔹 Nursing Vitals & Doctor Rounds

* Go to `/ipd/vitals/{patientId}`
* Nurse logs BP, temp, pulse at intervals
* Doctor logs round notes via `/ipd/rounds`
* Verify if entries are timestamped and shown in timeline

#### 🔹 Treatment Plan & Progress

* Visit `/ipd/treatment/{patientId}`
* Check active investigations, medication schedules
* Update status → e.g., “Blood test done”, “Fever subsiding”

#### 🔹 Discharge Summary Generation

* Go to `/ipd/discharge`
* Select patient → System shows hospitalization summary
* Click "Generate PDF" → Verify complete info (admission, treatment, final advice)
* Block download until full bill is cleared

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Pharmacy**

#### 🔹 Inventory Management

* Go to `/pharmacy/inventory`
* Add new medicines with batch, quantity, expiry
* Verify auto-alerts for low stock and near-expiry items

#### 🔹 Prescription Fulfillment

* Go to `/pharmacy/orders`
* New order auto-arrives when doctor prescribes → Click “Dispense”
* Select batch, quantity → Update stock
* Payment required for OPD; IPD items linked to bill

#### 🔹 Sales with Billing

* Go to `/pharmacy/sale`
* Add medicines manually for over-the-counter sales
* Generate bill → See tax split and total → Confirm payment method

#### 🔹 Return & Refund

* Go to `/pharmacy/return`
* Select invoice → Select items to return
* System updates stock and processes refund (original mode/credit note)

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ Billing & Payments**

#### 🔹 OPD Billing

* Go to `/billing/opd/{appointmentId}`
* Shows consultation + lab + procedure costs
* Pay via cash/card/UPI → System marks as “Paid”

#### 🔹 IPD Bill Consolidation

* Go to `/billing/ipd/{patientId}`
* View charges: room, surgery, medicine, labs
* Check bill split: paid, pending → Export PDF
* Mark as paid to unlock discharge summary

#### 🔹 Insurance & TPA Handling

* Go to `/billing/insurance`
* Upload documents → Select TPA (e.g., MediAssist)
* Submit → Track status (pending, approved, partial)

#### 🔹 Pending Payment Alerts

* Go to `/billing/dashboard`
* Check patient list → See unpaid amounts flagged in red
* Test “Remind” or “Settle Now” button functionality

---

### ✅ **🔄 Cross-Module Testing**

#### 🔹 Role-Based Access

* Login as: Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacist, Billing Staff
* Ensure proper access:

  * Pharmacist cannot update bills
  * Doctor cannot assign beds
  * Billing staff cannot modify prescriptions

#### 🔹 Audit Logs & Reports

* Go to `/admin/reports`
* Generate reports:

  * Daily OPD visits
  * Top 10 prescribed medicines
  * Unpaid bills
* Export in Excel/PDF

---

## 📦 Additional UI Notes

* Every form must have validations (required fields, date pickers, number limits)
* Auto-refresh dashboards every 10 seconds (e.g., beds, vitals)
* Use breadcrumbs, clear headers, and role-based menu items
* Responsiveness: Mobile/tablet-friendly interface
