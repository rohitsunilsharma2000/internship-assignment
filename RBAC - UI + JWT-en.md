## 🏥 Problem Statement: HMS Dashboard UI with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & JWT using Next.js + Tailwind

### 🎯 Objective:

Build a role-aware Dashboard in Next.js where only specific modules are visible to the logged-in user based on their assigned role. The role is extracted from a JWT token stored on login. This project helps beginners understand how RBAC and JWT-based authorization works in frontend applications.

---

### 👥 User Roles:

1. SUPER\_ADMIN
2. ADMIN
3. HR\_MANAGER
4. DOCTOR
5. NURSE
6. RECEPTIONIST
7. BILLING\_CLERK
8. PHARMACIST

---

### 🔐 JWT Authentication (Simulated):

* Create a simple login page with a dropdown to select a role.
* After login, generate a dummy JWT token and store it in localStorage or cookie:

  ```json
  {
    "username": "adminuser",
    "role": "ADMIN"
  }
  ```
* On the Dashboard page:

  * Read and decode the JWT token.
  * Extract the user's role.
  * Use that role to filter which UI modules should be visible.

📦 You can use jwt-decode or simply JSON.parse to simulate decoding.

### 🧭 Role-to-Module Access Matrix

| Logged-In Role | ✅ Can Access Modules                                                 | ❌ Cannot Access   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| SUPER\_ADMIN   | Admin Panel, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Billing, Pharmacy, Profile | –                 |
| ADMIN          | Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Billing, Pharmacy, Profile              | Admin Panel       |
| HR\_MANAGER    | Nurse, Receptionist, Billing Clerk, Profile                          | Admin, Doctor     |
| DOCTOR         | Profile, Patient List (optional)                                     | All other modules |
| NURSE          | Profile, Assigned Patients (optional)                                | Others            |
| RECEPTIONIST   | Profile, Appointment Dashboard                                       | Others            |
| BILLING\_CLERK | Profile, Billing Dashboard                                           | Others            |
| PHARMACIST     | Profile, Medicine Stock                                              | Others            |

---

### 🧾 Optional Modules

| Module                | Visible To     |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| Patient List          | DOCTOR         |
| Assigned Patients     | NURSE          |
| Appointment Dashboard | RECEPTIONIST   |
| Billing Dashboard     | BILLING\_CLERK |
| Medicine Stock        | PHARMACIST     |

---

### 🛠️ UI Implementation Tips (with Tailwind)

1. Build a mock login page with a role selection dropdown.
2. Simulate a JWT and store it in localStorage after login.
3. On the dashboard:

   * Read and decode the token.
   * Get the role and match against a JavaScript RBAC matrix object.
   * Conditionally render Tailwind-styled module cards.
4. If a user manually accesses an unauthorized route (e.g., /admin-panel), show a 403 Access Denied screen.
5. Add a logout button to clear the token and redirect to login.

### ✅ Example UI Behavior

* SUPER\_ADMIN logs in → sees all modules ✅
* HR\_MANAGER logs in → sees Nurse, Receptionist, Billing Clerk only ✅
* PHARMACIST logs in → sees only Profile and Medicine Stock ✅
* DOCTOR tries to visit /admin-panel → gets “🔒 Access Denied” ❌

* 🔐 How to simulate and decode JWT tokens
* 🎨 Using Tailwind CSS to conditionally style components
* 🧪 RBAC matrix configuration and access control logic
